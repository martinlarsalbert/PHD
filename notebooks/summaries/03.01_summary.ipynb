    "However, after a while when the simulation and real data begins to deviate (see Fig.1) this comparison is not so meaningfull anymore, as the simulation and real data are now in complete different states. If the simulation model is instead allowed to catch up with the real data, by updating with the real state, the simulated state and real state can be kept closer to each other, to allow for a more realistic comparison, also during the later stages of the simulation. This is instead the error of an online predictor that can make predictions into the nearby future, a number of steps ahead in a discrete time series. If the online predictor should only predict one step ahead, the predictor error is reduced to an acceleration prediction error, where the mathematical models ability to predict acceleration is assessed. When the inertia of ship and water is known, or assumed to be known, this is very closely related to assess the models ability to predict the forces correctly.\n",

    "# Conclusions\n",
    "* The present example corresponds to a full scale apparent wind speed of 27 m/s, which should be considered a sever condition.\n",
    "* acceleration prediction error $\\epsilon_a$ and force prediction error $\\epsilon_F$ are usefull measures to assess the prediction model error, that can help to highlight the weak spots of a model.\n",
    "* The wind forces seems to have a large influence on the total forces acting on the ship.\n",
    "* The wind speed and wind force coefficients also have large uncertainties.\n",
    "* The wind yaw moment in head winds has a destabilizing effect which can make the simulation diverge very rappidly from the real data if the apparent wind angle (awa) changes sign at the wrong place, which seems to be the case in the example above. \n",
    "* $\\beta$ - $r$ Hypothesis: the manoeuvring model may not be able to handle $\\beta>0$, $r \\approxeq 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Present uncertainties in the prediction model:\n",
    "* The hydrodynamic model has <u>low uncertainty</u> since it has been proven to work in a laboratory environment without wind.\n",
    "* The aerodynamic model has <u>high uncertainty</u> since it is based on coefficients from wind tunnel tests with a similar ship.\n",
    "* The wind speed has <u> medium uncertainty</u> since it was measured on the model, but is probably disturbed. A more robust wind speed prediction, for instance by assuming that the wind is constant during the test can perhaps reduce the uncertainty?\n",
    "* The wave force influence is neglected in this model, which also adds some uncertainty. Assumtion: the wave forces are expected to have a large impact on the first order motions which can be neglected when long term motions during a whole zigzag manoeuvre should be predicted.\n",
    "* Some initial neutral rudder angle is needed for the ship to go straight, even for cases when no wind is present. There seems to be some unsymmetry in how the ship was build, the rudders where mounted etc. This calls for a small (~2 deg) initial rudder angle. This initial neutral rudder angle is <u>uncertain</u> and needs further investigations. \n",
    "* The propeller speed is unknown. The propeller is run at fixed power (at some setting 70%,80%...). The propeller speed can however be estimated with <u>low/medium uncertainty</u> under these conditions.\n",
