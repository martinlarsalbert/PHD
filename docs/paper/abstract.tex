% Move 1 - Background/introduction/situation
System based manoeuvring models offers a very flexible way to assess the manoeuvring performance of ships, as an alternative or extension of ship model tests. A manoeuvring model can be created with system identification on captive model test experiments. This approach has the drawbacks of being very expensive, and not being feasible on the full scale ship. Much work has therefore been devoted on system identification on a free model/ship instead.
