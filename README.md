# System identification of a physics-informed ship model for better predictions in wind conditions
This repository contains research and experiments for the paper: *System identification of a physics-informed ship model for better predictions in wind conditions*.
The LaTeX for the actual paper is stored [here](https://github.com/martinlarsalbert/System-identification-for-a-physically-correct-ship-manoeuvring-model-in-wind-conditions_martin).
The research has been defined as a [Kedro pipeline](https://kedro.readthedocs.io) to enhance reproducibility.

## Reproduce the research for this paper
### Setup
The dependencies to this project have been defined in [environment.yml](environment.yml). The easiest way to setup a new project is to use [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html).

```
conda env create --prefix .conda --file environment.yml
```

### Copy data
The model test data for this research can be downloaded here: [Alexandersson, Martin (2024), “wPCC manoeuvring model tests”, Mendeley Data, V3, doi: 10.17632/j5zdrhr9bf.4](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/j5zdrhr9bf/4).
1. Copy the test files from "model tests" to: [/data/01_raw/wPCC/time_series/](/data/01_raw/wPCC/time_series/)
1. copy "runs_meta_data.csv" to: [/data/01_raw/wPCC](/data/01_raw/wPCC/) and rename it to "time_series_meta_data.csv"




To reproduce the entire research is a s simple as:
```
kedro run
```


## Analyze
The kedro pipelines processes the raw indata ([01_raw](./data/01_raw/)) and produces some new datasets and models that can be further analyzed in the jupyter notebooks ([notebooks](./notebooks/).)
The notebooks needs to be loaded with the "kedro" prefix so that the datasets are easily available:
```
kedro jupyter lab
```

## Recreate figures and tables from paper
The figures and tables in the paper are generated by the [paper notebooks](/docs/notebooks/). The output of the notebooks are stored in the [figures](/docs/System-identification-for-a-physically-correct-ship-manoeuvring-model-in-wind-conditions/figures), [tables](/docs/System-identification-for-a-physically-correct-ship-manoeuvring-model-in-wind-conditions/tables), and [equations](/docs/System-identification-for-a-physically-correct-ship-manoeuvring-model-in-wind-conditions/equations) folders.
For a full recreation you also need the LaTeX for the paper [here](https://github.com/martinlarsalbert/System-identification-for-a-physically-correct-ship-manoeuvring-model-in-wind-conditions_martin).


## Overview

This is your new Kedro project, which was generated using `Kedro 0.18.14`.

Take a look at the [Kedro documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io) to get started.

## Rules and guidelines

In order to get the best out of the template:

* Don't remove any lines from the `.gitignore` file we provide
* Make sure your results can be reproduced by following a [data engineering convention](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq/faq.html#what-is-data-engineering-convention)
* Don't commit data to your repository
* Don't commit any credentials or your local configuration to your repository. Keep all your credentials and local configuration in `conf/local/`

## How to install dependencies

Declare any dependencies in `src/requirements.txt` for `pip` installation and `src/environment.yml` for `conda` installation.

To install them, run:

```
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```

## How to run your Kedro pipeline

You can run your Kedro project with:

```
kedro run
```

## How to test your Kedro project

Have a look at the file `src/tests/test_run.py` for instructions on how to write your tests. You can run your tests as follows:

```
kedro test
```

To configure the coverage threshold, go to the `.coveragerc` file.

## Project dependencies

To generate or update the dependency requirements for your project:

```
kedro build-reqs
```

This will `pip-compile` the contents of `src/requirements.txt` into a new file `src/requirements.lock`. You can see the output of the resolution by opening `src/requirements.lock`.

After this, if you'd like to update your project requirements, please update `src/requirements.txt` and re-run `kedro build-reqs`.

## How to work with Kedro and notebooks

> Note: Using `kedro jupyter` or `kedro ipython` to run your notebook provides these variables in scope: `context`, `catalog`, and `startup_error`.
>
> Jupyter, JupyterLab, and IPython are already included in the project requirements by default, so once you have run `pip install -r src/requirements.txt` you will not need to take any extra steps before you use them.

### Jupyter
To use Jupyter notebooks in your Kedro project, you need to install Jupyter:

```
pip install jupyter
```

After installing Jupyter, you can start a local notebook server:

```
kedro jupyter notebook
```

### JupyterLab
To use JupyterLab, you need to install it:

```
pip install jupyterlab
```

You can also start JupyterLab:

```
kedro jupyter lab
```

### IPython
And if you want to run an IPython session:

```
kedro ipython
```

### How to convert notebook cells to nodes in a Kedro project
You can move notebook code over into a Kedro project structure using a mixture of [cell tagging](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#release-5-0-0) and Kedro CLI commands.

By adding the `node` tag to a cell and running the command below, the cell's source code will be copied over to a Python file within `src/<package_name>/nodes/`:

```
kedro jupyter convert <filepath_to_my_notebook>
```
> *Note:* The name of the Python file matches the name of the original notebook.

Alternatively, you may want to transform all your notebooks in one go. Run the following command to convert all notebook files found in the project root directory and under any of its sub-folders:

```
kedro jupyter convert --all
```

### How to ignore notebook output cells in `git`
To automatically strip out all output cell contents before committing to `git`, you can run `kedro activate-nbstripout`. This will add a hook in `.git/config` which will run `nbstripout` before anything is committed to `git`.

> *Note:* Your output cells will be retained locally.
